        <h2>You&#39;re moving to the valley...</h2>
        <p>
          You&#39;ve inherited your grandfather&#39;s old farm plot in Stardew
          Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out
          to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn
          these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won&#39;t be easy.
          Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have
          all but disappeared. The community center, once the town&#39;s most
          vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems
          full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the
          one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!
